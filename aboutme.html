            Janatha Garage becomes popular among the local people as they believe that they'll get
             justice from them. Shiva marries a Mumbai-based man Suresh's sister, and they have a 
             son Anand. One day Mukesh, a powerful entrepreneur with lot of criminal dealings and 
             who was also the brother of a goon who was killed by Sathyam, visits and warns him. 
             A few days later, Shiva and his wife get ambushed by Mukesh's men, and both are killed. 
             Sathyam, fearing for Anand's safety, asks Suresh to take him away from his family and Janatha Garage.
